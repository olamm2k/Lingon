I deleted the special routines to handle this case.  Now you just call the standard routines, passing them kTemporaryFolderType.Revision 1.7  2003/08/08 15:37:36  eskimo1Added support for helper tools in the Temporary Items folder. Also, changed some definitions to use the word "ownership" instead of "privileges", because that's what the Finder checkbox actually controls.Revision 1.6  2003/05/25 12:30:58  eskimo1Added support for descriptor passing.Revision 1.5  2003/01/20 07:58:32  eskimo1Corrected some misspellings.Revision 1.4  2002/12/12 17:47:57  eskimo1There should only be one point 5 in the "how to use" comment.Revision 1.3  2002/12/12 15:40:19  eskimo1Eliminate MoreAuthCopyRightCFString because it makes no sense.  A helper tool should always have the right name hard-wired into it, and hardwiring a C string is even easier than hardwiring a CFString.Revision 1.2  2002/11/25 16:42:29  eskimo1Significant changes. Handle more edge cases better (for example, volumes with the "ignore permissions" flag turned on). Also brought MoreSecurity more into the CoreServices world.Revision 1.1  2002/11/09 00:08:40  eskimo1First checked in.

If it's     // non-zero you probably should err on the side of     // caution and refuse to start up./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#pragma mark **** Helper Tool Big Picture// These utilities let you easily implement a setuid helper tool.// This design is largely stolen from the DTS sample code "AuthSample", // with refinements to cover more cases and allow easy code reuse.// // <http://developer.apple.com/samplecode/Sample_Code/Security/AuthSample.htm>//// To create a setuid root help tool, follow these simple instructions.//// 1. Define a request/response protocol based around CFDictionaries.//    This is as simple as defining the set of keys in the request //    that describe the operation you want to do, and the set of //    keys in the response that hold the results of those operations //    (if any).//// 2. Create a helper tool whose "main" function looks like:////  	int main(int argc, const char *argv[])//  	{	//  		int 				err;//  		int 				result;//  		AuthorizationRef 	auth;//  		//  		auth = MoreSecHelperToolCopyAuthRef();//  	//  		err = MoreSecDestroyInheritedEnvironment(kMoreSecKeepStandardFilesMask, argv);//  		if (err == 0) {//  			err = MoreUNIXIgnoreSIGPIPE();//  		}//  		if (err == 0) {//  			err = MoreSecHelperToolMain(STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, auth, MyCommandProc, argc, argv);//  		}//  	//  		return MoreSecErrorToHelperToolResult(err);//  	}// //    MyCommandProc is a callback that is executed when a request is //    passed to the tool.  It can do privileged operations, such as //    committing changes to System Configuration framework.  Its //    parameters are passed to it as a CFDictionary.  It can pass results //    back to the application by creating a response dictionary.//// 3. Put the tool in the "MacOS" folder inside your application package.//    Decide on two tool names, one for the original template tool //    (for example, "HelperToolTemplate") and one for the working copy //    of the tool (for example, "HelperTool").//// 4. In your application, use MoreSecCopyHelperToolURLAndCheckBundled to find //    (or create) the working copy of your tool.  // //		err = MoreSecCopyHelperToolURLAndCheckBundled(//			CFBundleGetMainBundle(), //			CFSTR("HelperToolTemplate"), //			kApplicationSupportFolderType, //			CFSTR("My Application Name"), //			CFSTR("HelperTool"), //			&tool//		);//    //    The working copy of the helper tool will exist within the user's //    Application Support folder.  See the description of //    MoreSecCopyHelperToolURLAndCheck[Bundled] for an explanation of this.////    You should be prepared to get the error kMoreSecFolderInappropriateErr //    from the above routine.  This error, and how you can handle it, is //    discussed below.// // 5. Then use MoreSecExecuteRequestInHelperTool to execute the tool, passing it //    a request dictionary.  On success, you'll get back a response dictionary.  Use //    MoreSecGetErrorFromResponse to extract the error result from your tool's //    MyCommandProc routine.//// 6. For extra credit, use AuthorizationCopyRights to have your tool //    be self-limiting, as described in the Authorization Services docs.////    <http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/macosx/CoreTechnologies/securityservices/authorizationservices/authservices.html>// //              *              *              *              *//// This complex design is required for a number of reasons.// //  o The technique of using a self-limiting setuid root helper tool is //    recommended by Apple's security team.// //  o You need to use a working helper tool and a backup helper tool //    because of the problems in the Mac OS X Finder.  The problems //    are as follows:////    - In Mac OS X 10.0.x, the Finder will silently not copy the  //      setuid root attribute of a helper program within your bundle.////    - In Mac OS X 10.1.x, the Finder will not copy the setuid root //      helper program within your bundle (and display a wacky error //      dialog).////    - In Mac OS X 10.2.x, the Finder will refuse to copy an application //      that contains a setuid root helper tool.////  o It's a general requirement that a Mac OS X application be //    self-contained, that is, it should be drag installable and not //    require the user to run an installer.////  o It's a general requirement that a Mac OS X application be runnable //    from a read-only volume (like a CD-ROM).  Thus, you can't place //    the helper tool within the application bundle because copying it //    there would require the volume be writable.////  o Users can choose to ignore ownership on a particular volume //    by checking a checkbox in the Finder Get Info window.  A setuid //    program on an volume that's ignoring ownership will not be //    effective (ie it won't run as EUID 0).////  o Users in a managed environment often have NFS home directories.//    Most NFS installations do not allow you to create setuid root //    on the NFS server.//// By placing the setuid root helper tool within the Application Support // folder, this code allows you to copy the application bundle from // one disk to another without breaking it and without any weird error // dialogs.  In addition, you can copy the program to another machine // entirely, and the only thing the user has to do is to reenter their // admin password when they first run the application.  Finally, the // user's Application Support folder is typically inside their home // directory, which is typically on the system volume, and thus is // not ignoring ownership.//// Finally, MoreSecCopyHelperToolURLAndCheck[Bundled] might return the error // kMoreSecFolderInappropriateErr, which means that the user's // "Application Support" folder is on a volume that doesn't support // file ownership.  Typically this is either an HFS Plus volume where // the user has turned on "Ignore ownership of this volume" in the // Finder's Get Info window, or it's a file system type that doesn't // support setuid binaries (for example, the user has an NFS home // directory).  In this case, you have a number of choices.//// 1. You can display an error to the user telling them what's wrong //    and what to do about it.  There are two general types of solutions.////    a) The user can reenable ownership on their volume.// //    b) The user can ask a system administrator to install the setuid //       root helper tool in one of the standard places that //       MoreSecCopyHelperToolURLAndCheck[Bundled] looks for it (see //       the MoreSecCopyHelperToolURLAndCheck comment for details).//// 2. You can create a temporary copy of the helper tool by passing //    kTemporaryFolderType to the folder parameter of //    MoreSecCopyHelperToolURLAndCheck[Bundled].  The temporary items //    folder should always be appropriate.  If you do this, you may want //    to warn the user about this, because the tool will be periodically //    deleted.//// This technique may also be useful if the user's home directory is // read-only because you're booted from a CD./////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////#pragma mark **** Helper Tool Implementation// The following are special error codes used by the helper tool code. // These error codes can be mapped to the helper tool return status // (ie the result from main).  For example, kMoreSecResultParamErr maps // to a return status of 1, kMoreSecResultPrivilegesErr maps to 2, // and so on.enum {	kMoreSecResultBase			   = 5360,	kMoreSecResultParamErr         = 5361,	kMoreSecResultPrivilegesErr    = 5362,	kMoreSecResultCanceledErr      = 5363, 	kMoreSecResultInternalErrorErr = 5364,		kMoreSecFirstResultErr = kMoreSecResultParamErr,	kMoreSecLastResultErr  = kMoreSecResultInternalErrorErr		// other errors defined below};extern int MoreSecErrorToHelperToolResult(int errNum);	// A function to map an errno/OSStatus to a helper tool return 	// status.

However, 	// a helper tool is *supposed* to blow away its environment 	// (using MoreSecDestroyInheritedEnvironment) to minimise security 	// risks.  This routine allows the tool to recover the parameters 	// supplied by AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges before it 	// calls MoreSecDestroyInheritedEnvironment to destroy the environment.	// 	// IMPORTANT: It's quite normal for this routine to return NULL.	// You should just pass the result straight to MoreSecHelperToolMain.typedef OSStatus (*MoreSecCommandProc)(AuthorizationRef auth, 									   CFDictionaryRef request, CFDictionaryRef *response);	// This is a callback type, called by MoreSecHelperToolMain to 	// actually execute commands.	// 	// auth will not be NULL	// request will not be NULL	// response will not be NULL	// *response will be NULL	//	// The EUID will be set to the RUID, while the SUID will be 0.	// If you need to do a privileged operation, you should 	// temporarily set the EUID to 0 via MoreSecSetPrivilegedEUID,	// and set it back whenh you're done via MoreSecTemporarilySetNonPrivilegedEUID.	//	// If you don't need to return anything other than a function 	// result to your client, you don't need to mess with response.	// MoreSecHelperToolMain will create a dictionary containing 	// your function result and pass that back to the client.	// Even if you do return a dictionary in *response, 	// MoreSecHelperToolMain will still put your function result into the 	// kMoreSecErrorNumberKey key unless you've set up that key yourself.	//	// If you want to self-limit the capabilities of your helper tool, 	// you might consider using AuthorizationCopyRights to make sure 	// that the user has authorization to do specific operations.	// 	// If you do create a response, it must be it must be flattenable via 	// the CFPropertyList APIs.	//	// If the response contains a key kMoreSecFileDescriptorsKey, that key 	// must be an array of valid file descriptors.  [See the declaration of 	// kMoreSecFileDescriptorsKey for more information on the format.]  Those file 	// descriptors are passed back to the calling process via descriptor passing on 	// a UNIX domain socket.  This allows your helper tool to open privileged 	// descriptors (for example, TCP sockets bound to a low-numbered port) and pass 	// them back to the calling application.	//	// These descriptors are closed by the MoreSecurity infrastructure or 	// by the calling process.  This is an unusual design style for me 	// (I ususually prefer that the entity that creates a resource be 	// responsible for destroying it), but it's unavoidable in this case. 	// The descriptors are opened by customised code (that is, this callback 	// but no other customised code is executed before the tool returns 	// from main, so there's no opportunity for customised code to close the 	// descriptors.  Hence MoreSecurity must do it for you.extern int MoreSecHelperToolMain(int fdIn, int fdOut, AuthorizationRef auth, 								 MoreSecCommandProc commandProc, int argc, const char *argv[]);	// This function is the helper tool half of MoreSecExecuteRequestInHelperTool.	// It's designed to be called directly from your helper tool's "main" function, 	// and to implement the entire tool, calling commandProc to handle the specific 	// command.	//	// IMPORTANT: Contrary to the usual rules, this routine disposes of 	// auth before returning.
